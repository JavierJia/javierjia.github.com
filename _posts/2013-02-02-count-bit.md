Here is one excelent algorithm to detect the bit number of 1 

 inline int count_number_bits_set(long l) {
     unsigned int c;
       for(c=0;l;c++)
              l &= l-1;
               return c;
 }

every time, get rid of the last 1 from the l 

it is said invented by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan]
