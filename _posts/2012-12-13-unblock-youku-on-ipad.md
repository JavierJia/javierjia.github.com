The add-on of Chrome works fine. And the author also give one solution for ipad or iphone:

 [instruction on github](https://github.com/zhuzhuor/Unblock-Youku/wiki/%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E7%A4%BA%E4%BE%8B)

The basic idea is running a middle server on mac, and let the ipad or other ios device connect through this server. 
Great idea. Wonderful work!
