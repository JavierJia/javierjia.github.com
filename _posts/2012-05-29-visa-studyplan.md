## Study Plan
### Background
I have been a software engineer and a associate researcher at Sogou.com company for almost 4 years.
In this company I am in charge of the research and development for the famous Sogou Chinese Input Method Editor (**IME**) used by millions of people. 

Before that I had finished my Master Degree on Computer Science of Xiamen University. 
My master thesis was focus on Statistical Machine Translation which is a subcategory of Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) fields.

My work at Sogou demand a solid background of research experience on NLP field as well as a strong ability of large data processing. 
When the same NLP problem comes with large scale data, the traditional method would not effect any more.
As my work goes on, I am being more and more interested on solving newly problems with large data. 
So I decided to suspend my current work and apply to top academic organizations to pursue my research on NLP.

### Why UCI
UCI have several top research groups on NLP and Database. 
The Information System Group (**ISG**) group is focus on the next generation of Information Retrieval combining with database. 
They have published a lot of research papers in the first-rate journals which testifies its leading role in the academic community.

My potential advisor Prof. Chen Li (chenli@ics.uci.edu), a distinguished scientist in Database and Information Retrieval, has been performing some very pioneering research. 
His researches on Query Correction and Parallel Computation are closely corresponds to the research I have been doing. 
I have read his voluminous publications and wish to enter his laboratory. 

Further more, the School is offering me the necessary financial assistance to fully cover tuition and living expenses.

Thus with advanced facilities, abundant research funds, and outstanding researchers, I believe ISG at UCI is the best choice to pursue my Ph.D study.

### Plan
The whole Ph.D program will last 5 years at most. During the first 2 years, I will concentrate on obtaining 47 units of graduate credit, 12 units each quarter.
And in order to keep eligible for my fellowship, I will do my best to make my every course reach A level.

I will begin to do research with my advisor since the second year and start from the Query Correction Project first.
In that project I will use my NLP experiences as well be learning the leading knowledge of computation on the large data.

After that I hope to participate in the FLAMINGO Project on Data Cleaning i.e., how to deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems.
I will have 2 or 3 years to study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding-computing infrastructure.
And write my dissertation on it.

### Come Back Reason
First, what I want to be is a professor in university. 
The first choice for me is Xiamen University (XMU) where I spent 7 years. There I retained a great pack of sweet memory. 
I am still keeping close touch with my master degree tutor Prof. Xiaodong Shi (mandel@xmu.edu.cn) now. 
When I asked him about the possibilities of come back to XMU, he also advised me to obtain a Ph.D in the world top university first.
The Ph.D student from the better university will have the better promote of the future work. 

Second, I am the only son of my parents. It is my important duty to come back and take care of them according to Chinese tradition.

Thus I will come back China as soon as I have accomplished the study at UCI.
